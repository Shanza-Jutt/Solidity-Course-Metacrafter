# Project Title

## Token Management Smart Contract

### Description

This project features a straightforward Solidity smart contract designed for token creation and management. It encompasses functions for minting new tokens and burning existing ones.

## Getting Started

## Installation

### To use this contract, follow these steps:

    Download the Solidity contract file (Token.sol) to your local machine.

    Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up. Tools like Remix or Truffle can be helpful for development.

## Execution

### To deploy and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

    Deploy the Token contract to a supported blockchain network, such as `Ethereum`.

    Initialize the contract by specifying the `token name`, `symbol`, and `initial supply`.

    Utilize the `mint` function to generate new tokens and allocate them to specific addresses.

    Use the `burn` function to remove existing tokens, provided that the sender possesses enough tokens to burn.
